## Binder IPC: Available on Linux, Untapped Potential

While Android's Binder IPC mechanism was merged into the Linux kernel back in 2015, its adoption within the broader Linux ecosystem remains limited. This project aims to address that by providing libraries and tools specifically designed for using Binder IPC in Linux environments.

One key reason for limited adoption is the lack of readily available tools and libraries optimized for the Linux world. This project tackles that challenge by leveraging Rust's strengths for efficient thread utilization, a crucial aspect for maximizing Binder IPC performance on Linux.

However, this project focuses on pure Rust implementations. If you're interested in C++-based Binder IPC for Linux, consider checking out the [binder-linux](https://github.com/hiking90/binder-linux) project.

Although this project focuses on supporting Binder IPC in the Linux environment, it also provides compatibility with Android's Binder IPC. [Compatibility Goal with Android Binder](#Compatibility-Goal-with-Android-Binder)

## Key Advantages of Using rsbinder for Android Development
The **rsbinder** library unlocks a significant opportunity for Android developers who prefer to use Rust for system-level programming. While Android provides an environment that supports Rust development, it lacks a dedicated API in its SDK or NDK for direct low-level interaction with Binder IPC using Rust. This gap is where **rsbinder** comes into play.

By integrating **rsbinder** into your project, you gain the ability to harness Binder IPC directly within the Android NDK environment using pure Rust.

## Current Development Status
**rsbinder** is still in its early development stages and is not yet ready for production use.

## Overview
**rsbinder** offers the following features:

* **crate rsbinder**: A library crate for implementing binder service/client functionality.
* **[crate rsbinder-aidl][rsbinder-aidl-readme]**: A tool for generating Rust code for rsbinder from aidl.
* **[crate rsbinder-tools][rsbinder-tools-readme]**: Provides CLI tools, including a Binder Service Manager for Linux.
* **[crate tests][tests-readme]**: Port Androidâ€™s binder test cases to provide various client/server testing features.
* **[crate example-hello][example-hello-readme]**: An example of service/client written using rsbinder.

## Prerequisites to build and test

### Enable binder for Linux
* The Linux kernel must be built with support for binderfs. Please ensure the following kernel configs are enabled:
```
CONFIG_ANDROID=y
CONFIG_ANDROID_BINDER_IPC=y
CONFIG_ANDROID_BINDERFS=y
```

* Arch Linux - Install linux-zen kernel. Zen kernel already includes BinderFS.
```
$ pacman -S linux-zen
```
* Ubuntu Linux - https://github.com/anbox/anbox/blob/master/docs/install.md

### Build rsbinder
Build all rsbinder crates.
```
$ cargo build
```

#### Run rsbinder tools
* Run the **[rsb_device]** command to create a binder device file.
```
$ sudo target/debug/rsb_device binder
```
[rsb_device]: https://github.com/hiking90/rsbinder/blob/master/rsbinder-tools/README.md
* Run **[rsb_hub]**, which is a binder service manager.
```
$ cargo run --bin rsb_hub
```
[rsb_hub]: https://github.com/hiking90/rsbinder/blob/master/rsbinder-tools/README.md

### Test binder for Linux
* Run **hello_service**
```
$ cargo run --bin hello_service
```
* Run **hello_client**
```
$ cargo run --bin hello_client
```

### Cross compile to Android device
* Please follow the guideline of https://github.com/bbqsrc/cargo-ndk

## Compatibility Goal with Android Binder

### Mutual Communication:
Both rsbinder and Android Binder utilize the same core protocol, enabling seamless communication between Android services and rsbinder clients, and vice versa. However, continued development is currently underway to further refine this interoperability.

### Protocol Level Compatibility:
**rsbinder** implements the same low-level Binder protocol as Android, ensuring binary compatibility at the kernel interface level. This means:
- **Transaction Format**: Uses identical `binder_transaction_data` structures
- **Object Types**: Supports all Android Binder object types (BINDER, HANDLE, FD)
- **Command Protocols**: Implements the same ioctl commands (BC_*/BR_* protocol)
- **Memory Management**: Compatible parcel serialization and shared memory handling

### Android Version Support:
**rsbinder** provides feature flags for different Android versions to handle API evolution:
```toml
# Enable specific Android version compatibility
[features]
android_11 = []      # Android 11 (API 30)
android_12 = []      # Android 12 (API 31)
android_13 = []      # Android 13 (API 33)
android_14 = []      # Android 14 (API 34)
android_16 = []      # Android 16 (API 36)
android_11_plus = ["android_11", "android_12", "android_13", "android_14", "android_16"]
```

### AIDL Compatibility:
The **rsbinder-aidl** compiler generates Rust code that maintains compatibility with Android's AIDL:
- **Interface Definition**: Same `.aidl` syntax and semantics
- **Data Types**: Support for all AIDL primitive and complex types
- **Parcelable**: Compatible serialization with Android's Parcelable

### API Differences:
Complete API parity between rsbinder and Android Binder isn't available due to fundamental differences in their underlying architectures:

## Todo
- [x] Implement Binder crate.
- [x] Implement AIDL compiler.
- [x] Implement ParcelFileDescriptor.
- [x] Port Android test_service and test_client and pass the test cases.
- [x] Support Tokio async.
- [x] Remove all todo!() and unimplemented!() macros.
- [x] Perform compatibility testing with Binder on Android.
- [ ] (In Progress) Implement Service Manager(**rsb_hub**) for Linux
- [ ] Enhance error detection in AIDL code generator

## Notice
Many of the source codes in **rsbinder** have been developed by quoting or referencing Android's binder implementation.
