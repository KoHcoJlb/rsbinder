# rsbinder-hub
This provides an API for the Binder service manager. Using this API, one can create a servicemanager or use the features offered by the servicemanager.

In rsbinder, instead of the long word 'servicemanager', 'hub' is used. Therefore, the crate name is **rsbinder-hub**.

The CLI command that offers the functionalities of the servicemanager is **rsb_hub**.
The **rsb_hub** can be installed through **crate rsbinder-tools**.
